# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Project
 I recently worked on an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis project focused on pizza sales.
🔍 Project Highlights:
Using real-world pizza sales data, I explored:
💰 Total revenue from pizza sales
🍕 Top 5 most ordered pizzas (by quantity)
🧀 Highest-priced pizza
📏 Most common pizza size
📦 Category-wise quantity sold
📅 Average pizzas ordered per day
🥇 Top 3 pizzas by revenue
📊 Percentage contribution to revenue
📈 Cumulative revenue over time
📂 Top 3 pizzas by category revenue
🛠 Tools Used:
✅ MySQL
 ✅ Window Functions (OVER, RANK, PARTITION BY)
 ✅ Aggregations & Joins
 ✅ CTEs for clean, modular queries
📎 The project helped me sharpen my SQL skills — especially working with window functions, subqueries, and grouped analytics.
